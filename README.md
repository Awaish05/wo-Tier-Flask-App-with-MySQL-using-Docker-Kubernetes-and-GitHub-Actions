✅ Work Completed So Far
1. Flask Application Setup

    Built a simple Flask app (main.py) with MySQL integration.

    Added requirements.txt and created a working Dockerfile.

2. Database Setup

    Wrote init.sql for MySQL DB initialization.

    Created Kubernetes manifest for MySQL deployment and service.

3. Docker

    Containerized the Flask app.

    Tested the Docker image locally.

4. Kubernetes Deployment

    Created k8s/ folder with:

        flask-deployment.yaml

        flask-service.yaml

        mysql-deployment.yaml

        mysql-service.yaml

        namespace.yaml

    Deployed both MySQL and Flask apps on Minikube.

    Verified the service using:

    kubectl port-forward service/flask-service 8080:80 -n flask-app
    curl http://localhost:8080  ✅ Worked!

5. GitHub Integration

    Pushed the entire project to a GitHub repository.

    Resolved push errors using git pull --rebase before git push.

6. GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

    .github/workflows/github-actions.yml file created.

    CI/CD pipeline planned but not yet completed.

This is 80% of the full project ✅

Do you want the final version of the README.md file with only this much work written?
I can generate it and upload it to your project right now.
